    "> A homeowner near DTU wants to install solar panels on his detached house with a flat roof. He thinks he should orient them towards the south but is unsure about the angle the panel should form with the roof. In this project, you are to find the optimal angle for the homeowner's solar panels. The goal of the project is to develop a model and a Python program that, given the location on Earth (latitude and longitude), can calculate the optimal angle for the installation of solar panels under a set of simplifying assumptions. Data from the calendar year 2024 will be used for simulation. You will begin by modeling the movement of the sun in the sky using the Python package *[pvlib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)*. Then, you will establish a model for the solar panel's energy production, which does not account for clouds and the atmosphere. The sun is modeled as a vector field of parallel vectors. To calculate the energy production, you must be able to integrate the flux of the vector field through the solar panel surface. Initially, we assume the panel is flat, but you will subsequently generalize your model. One possibility for generalization is as follows: Find a suitable surface in the urban environment around DTU that can be equipped with thin, flexible solar panel films (like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS9ADU0oc50) and calculate the energy production from such solutions."

    "Solar energy is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity using solar cells (photovoltaic (PV) cells). The production of power by solar panels depends on the size of the installation (the number of panels), the individual efficiency of the panels, their placement, and, of course, weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar irradiance, or solar irradiance, is the power per unit area (surface power density) received from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the instrument's wavelength range. Solar irradiance is measured in watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W/m^2}$) in SI units. Solar radiation has different wavelengths, such as UV radiation, which collectively are called the spectrum of radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *average* annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is about $1361 \\,\\mathrm{W/m}^2$. When the sun's rays have passed through the atmosphere, the total radiation (irradiance) in Denmark is approximately $S_0 := 1100 \\,\\mathrm{W/m^2}$ on a clear day at noon. The spectrum also changes through the atmosphere; for example, the shortest UV radiation (below 280 nanometers) rarely reaches the Earth's surface, but we will ignore such spectral changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a good approximation, one can assume a linear relationship between the solar irradiance and the current output of the solar panel, and we will use this approximation. However, since the temperature in practice increases with increased irradiance, and the voltage decreases with increased temperature, the effect will not increase entirely linearly. The sun's rays are modeled as a vector field $\\pmb{V}_S$ of parallel vectors of length $S_0$. Let's assume that the solar panel is described by a surface $\\mathcal{F} = \\pmb{r}(\\Gamma)$, where $\\pmb{r} : \\Gamma \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, $\\Gamma = [a_1,b_1] \\times [a_2,b_2]$, is a parameterization of the surface. The energy production for a solar cell depends on the angle between the surface's normal vector $\\pmb{n}_\\mathcal{F}$ and the solar rays. If the solar rays are parallel to the normal vector, the solar power is maximum, while if the solar rays are perpendicular to the normal vector, the power is zero. The solar power per unit area at the point $\\pmb{r}(u,v)$, where $(u,v) \\in \\Gamma$, is the projection of the solar rays onto the surface's unit normal vector:\n",

    "To be able to calculate, for example, the movement of the sun and the projection of the sun's rays onto the panel's normal vector, we need to introduce (at least) an appropriate coordinate system. We choose to place a fixed center (origin) $(0,0,0)$ at the panel's position. We then imagine the tangent plane to the Earth at the panel's position. The normal vector to this tangent plane will be our $z$-axis. The $x$-axis and $y$-axis thus \"span\" the tangent plane. We define the coordinate system such that the $x$-axis points north and the $y$-axis points east. The attentive reader will have noticed that this is a left-handed coordinate system. However, this is the tradition, and the coordinate system is called the horizontal coordinate system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system). So now we have a reference solar position system that focuses on the observer (the panel) at a given latitude and longitude on the Earth's surface. Let's summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The coordinate system has its center at the solar panel (called the observer). It is traditional to use a left-handed coordinate system where the $x$-axis points north, the $y$-axis points east, and the $z$-axis points toward the zenith point in the direction of the normal vector to the tangent plane. The coordinate system is called the horizontal coordinate system because it is oriented according to the observer's local horizon.\n",
    "2. Any object can be described in the horizontal coordinate system either in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ or spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$. Here, $ \\phi \\in [0,2\\pi]$ is the azimuth angle measured from the $x$-axis towards the $y$-axis, $ \\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$ is the zenith angle from the $z$-axis, and $r$ is the radius.\n",
    "3. The horizontal coordinate system is fixed to a location on Earth, not the stars or the sun. Objects in the starry sky are imagined to be located on the celestial sphere at a fixed distance, and their position is described by azimuth and zenith angles (radius is thus ignored in this type of description). Over time, the zenith and azimuth angles for an object in the sky (such as the sun) will change as the object appears to move across the sky due to the Earth's rotation. Since the horizontal coordinate system is defined by the observer's local *horizon*, the same object seen from different locations on Earth at the same time will have different values of azimuth and zenith.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Source: https://assessingsolar.org/notebooks/solar_position.html](solar_position_system.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure the angles either in radians $(\\theta, \\phi) \\in [0, \\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ or degrees $(\\theta,\\phi) \\in [0, 180^\\circ] \\times [0, 360^\\circ]$. Another commonly used angle is the solar elevation angle ($\\alpha$), which is complementary to the zenith solar angle ($\\alpha = 90^\\circ - \\theta$), measuring the angle from the horizontal plane towards the $z$-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write a Python function `def solar_elevation_angle(theta)` that, given $\\theta$ in degrees, calculates $\\alpha$ in degrees."

Find a datasheet for a solar panel film that can reasonably be used on the selected building surface and provide the relevant data.

Consider the sphere $r_{tree}=10\\,\\mathrm m$ with the center at the Origin (the panel's position) and describe the tree's shape on this sphere. A simple model is as follows: Assume that there are only two possibilities: either $0\\%$ shadow or $100 \\%$ shadow. Calculate the surface area of the entire sphere as a function of $r_{tree}$, assume a size of the tree crown (e.g., its approximate diameter), and calculate approximately where the tree shades in zenith and azimuth degrees. This could be that there is $100 \\%$ shadow when $\\theta \\in [70,80]$ and $\\phi \\in [150,160]$, and the energy intake must therefore be subtracted when the sun is in this interval. The shape of the tree becomes somewhat unnatural when using axis-parallel areas in the $(\\theta,\\phi)$ plane. What shape does it correspond to on the sphere $r_{tree}=10\\,\\mathrm m$? Discuss how much effect shadows from trees and buildings can have. Is it possible to describe a perfectly spherical tree crown? How would this shape look on the sphere $r_{tree}$?\n",
